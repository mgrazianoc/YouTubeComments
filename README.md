# YouTubeComments
Basic program to retrieve mainly Youtube comments from a given YouTube Video Id



Notes:
get_comments.py is the program. It is set to retrieve 100 comments in a single video

hello_world.json is just an example of comments from a video

raw_data_example.json is the whole raw data retrieved by YouTube API from the same example in hello_world, which contains some junk


Key.txt is where you want to put your Youtube Developer Key. Do not left any blank line or space in it!
